## ‚ú® Project Purpose

This project aims to provide a tool for analyzing the sentiment expressed within legal texts. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, it helps identify and quantify the emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral) present in legal documents, which can be valuable for various applications such as case analysis, contract review, or legal research.

## üöÄ Features

*   Upload or input legal text for analysis.
*   Receive sentiment scores (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
*   Visualize sentiment distribution within the text.
*   API endpoint for programmatic access to sentiment analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built as a monorepo using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/).

**Frontend (Web Application):**

*   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React Framework)
*   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (for styling)
*   Shared UI components (`packages/ui`)

**Backend (API):**

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/)
*   [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (Web Framework)
*   Relevant NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy, Transformers - *specify if known*)

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows a monorepo structure managed by pnpm and TurboRepo:

*   `apps/`: Contains the main applications.
    *   `api/`: The Python backend API.
    *   `web/`: The Next.js frontend web application.
*   `packages/`: Contains shared code and configurations.
    *   `eslint-config/`: Shared ESLint configurations.
    *   `typescript-config/`: Shared TypeScript configurations.
    *   `ui/`: Shared UI components (e.g., React components).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js:** Required for the frontend and monorepo tooling (pnpm, TurboRepo). Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). It is recommended to use a Node.js version compatible with Next.js (check Next.js documentation for details).
*   **Python:** Required for the backend API. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
*   **Docker (Optional):** If you prefer to run the project using Docker containers. Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/).

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/legal-sentiment-analysis.git
    cd legal-sentiment-analysis
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with the actual GitHub username/organization)*

2.  **Install pnpm:** If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project root and install dependencies for all workspaces:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Setup API Environment:**
    *   Navigate to the API directory: `cd apps/api`
    *   Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` (if available) or project requirements.
    *   Install Python dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming `uv` is used as per `uv.lock`)

5.  **Build and Run:**
    *   Return to the project root: `cd ../..`
    *   Build the project using TurboRepo:
        ```bash
        pnpm build
        ```
    *   Start the development servers for both the API and Web applications:
        ```bash
        pnpm dev
        ```
    *   The web application should be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the API at `http://localhost:8000` (or respective ports defined in configurations).

### Docker Setup (Alternative)

Alternatively, you can use Docker to build and run the project:

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t legal-sentiment-analysis .
    ```
2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 8000:8000 legal-sentiment-analysis
    ```

## üí° Future Enhancements

*   Integration with different sentiment analysis models.
*   Support for various legal document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
*   User authentication and profile management.
*   Database integration to store analysis results.
*   Advanced visualizations and reporting.
*   Fine-tuning models on specific legal datasets.
*   Adding support for other languages.
